# Introduction-To-Machine-Learning-Udacity

This repository is my learning experience on basic algorithms which are vastly used in Machine Learning.

List of such important Algorithms include:
- Naive_Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- K nearest neighbours
- Random-Forest (bagging Ensemble method)
- Extra-trees
- AdaBoost (boosting Ensemble method)
